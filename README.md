# VocabSheets
A Java program using GoogleSheetsAPI to extract key-value pairs for learning foreign language vocabulary.

Vocabulary Tester will be done as a separate program.

When run, the program extracts a Master Table in which you specify all the vocabularies.
An example Master Table can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Btg-_JYc3hP4e_xvKs6IAEcda9ilG6IW8iNPpwekfUk/

A table with vocabulary looks like this:

The Master Table ID can be set in Settings.java.
In future it will be in a separate file.
